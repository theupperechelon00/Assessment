# Assessment

Welcome to my **assessment** project. An overview of what i did and how i did.

I made an image gallery and using images from *Unsplash.com* for my internship assessment.

Firstly i created a repository on my Github account and named it **Assessment**.
I added a new branch to the file and called it **backup**.
Cloned the repository from  github to VScode.
Created the index.html,style.css and main.js file.
